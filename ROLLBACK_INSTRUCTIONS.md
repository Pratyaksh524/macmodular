## 📋 What Was Saved

### ✅ Working Features (All Stable)
- **BPM Calculation**: 10-300 BPM range working perfectly
- **12-Lead Display**: No cropping at any mm/mV setting
- **Expanded View**: Maximized by default, responsive 13-27 inch
- **Demo Mode**: Wave gain and wave speed both working
- **Control Panels**: Responsive sizing on maximize
- **Arrhythmia Detection**: Visual markers with history scroll
- **P Duration**: Live calculation (not hardcoded)
- **All Metrics**: Accurate calculations in expanded form

### 📁 Files Preserved
- `src/ecg/twelve_lead_test.py` (6299 lines) - BPM logic frozen
- `src/ecg/expanded_lead_view.py` (1712 lines) - Metrics accurate
- `src/ecg/recording.py` - Control panel responsive
- `src/dashboard/dashboard.py` - Settings sync
- `ecg_settings.json` - Current configuration
- `last_conclusions.json` - Latest data

### 📚 Documentation Added
- `HARDWARE_PROTOCOL_COMPARISON.md` - Binary protocol analysis
- `PROTOCOL_VISUAL_COMPARISON.txt` - Visual diagrams
- `RESPONSE_TO_HARDWARE_TEAM.md` - Implementation plan

## 🔄 HOW TO ROLLBACK (If Needed)

### Option 1: Soft Rollback (Keep files, reset to this commit)
```bash
cd /Users/deckmount/Downloads/modularecg-main
git reset --soft e139d0e
```
**Effect:** Moves back to this commit, keeps all file changes staged

---

### Option 2: Hard Rollback (Discard everything after this commit)
```bash
cd /Users/deckmount/Downloads/modularecg-main
git reset --hard e139d0e
```
**Effect:** ⚠️ **DESTRUCTIVE** - Completely restores to this exact state, loses all changes after

---

### Option 3: Create a Restore Branch (Safest)
```bash
cd /Users/deckmount/Downloads/modularecg-main
git checkout -b restore-stable-version e139d0e
```
**Effect:** Creates new branch from this commit, keeps current work intact

---

### Option 4: View This Commit Anytime
```bash
# See what changed in this commit
git show e139d0e

# See file at this commit
git show e139d0e:src/ecg/twelve_lead_test.py

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Before Binary Protocol Implementation
1. ✅ **DONE** - All current logic saved (commit `e139d0e`)
2. ⏳ **WAIT** - Get checksum formula from hardware team
3. ⏳ **WAIT** - Get signal voltage range (0-4095 → mV mapping)

### After Starting Binary Protocol Work
- Test thoroughly with sample packets first
- Keep this commit ID handy
- If anything breaks, rollback immediately

### To Push This Checkpoint to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK (One Command)

If the binary protocol implementation breaks everything:

```bash
git reset --hard e139d0e && git clean -fd
```

**This will:**
- Restore all files to this exact state
- Delete any new untracked files
- Return to 100% working condition

---

## ✅ Verification

To confirm you're at this commit:
```bash
git log -1 --oneline
```

Should show:
```
e139d0e 🔒 SAFE CHECKPOINT: All working logic preserved before binary protocol migration
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- **All tests passing**: BPM 10-300, UI responsive, metrics accurate
- **Production ready**: This version is stable for deployment
- **Safe to proceed**: Can now work on binary protocol with confidence
- **Rollback anytime**: Just use commit ID `e139d0e`
